     * <p>Prevents the sky layer from rendering when the fog distance is reduced
     * from the default. This helps prevent situations where the sky can be seen
     * through chunks culled by fog occlusion. This also fixes the vanilla issue
     * <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-152504">MC-152504</a> since it
     * is also caused by being able to see the sky through invisible chunks.</p>
     * 
     * <p>However, this fix comes with some caveats. When underwater, it becomes 
     * impossible to see the sun, stars, and moon since the sky is not rendered.
     * While this does not exactly match the vanilla game, it is consistent with
     * what Bedrock Edition does, so it can be considered vanilla-style. This is
     * also more "correct" in the sense that underwater fog is applied to chunks
     * outside of water, so the fog should also be covering the sun and sky.</p>
     * 
     * <p>When updating Sodium to new releases of the game, please check for new
     * ways the fog can be reduced in {@link BackgroundRenderer#applyFog(Camera, BackgroundRenderer.FogType, float, boolean, float)} ()}.</p>
